When to use implicit wait and when to use explicit wait?
The implicit wait is applied once for all the elements and the next wait cycle starts once the previous one completes. If such a situation matches your requirement, implicit wait commands are best in such cases. For example, if you want to perform a task only after the complete page loads, you can go ahead with pageLoadTimeout. But this wait should be applied anyways.

The explicit wait is conditional in nature. If you want to wait for only a few select elements based on conditions, the explicit wait is the way to go. However, implicit waits used without a solid understanding of scripts can lead to an unnecessarily long time for the completion of scripts.
